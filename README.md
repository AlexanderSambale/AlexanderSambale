- 🌱 I'm currently learning all there is about freelancing.
- 💬 Ask me about anything programming and AI related.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I want to be able to play beach volleyball when I am 100!
- 🔥 I would love to combine an [open source augmented reality headset](https://docs.projectnorthstar.org/project-north-star/) with an AI assistant or [talon](https://talonvoice.com).
- 👍 Open source software is my first choice.
